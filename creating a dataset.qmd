# Creating a dataset

Code to shrink the dataset with all of the wanding and environmental data into a more manageable dataset with just the Obear brook observations and relevant explanatory variables.

## Running Code

Load the dataset with all of the wanding and environmental data into R.
```{r load in data table}
cdWB <- read.csv("cdWB_All.csv", header=T)
```

Filter the dataset to include only the Obear brook observations.
```{r filter to just Obear}
library(dplyr)

#specify team names to keep
river_name <- 'wb obear'

#select all rows where team is in list of team names to keep
obear_All <- cdWB %>% filter(river %in% river_name)
head(obear_All)
```
